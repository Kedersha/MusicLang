<p>Mary is having a busy #week#. She is worried about her son, Andrew, who is #sick#, so it was hard for her to keep #track# of her schedule. She almost forgot about the #special# dinner tonight, even though she had #written# it down in red #pen# so she would remember. She doesn’t want to go to the dinner with Andrew at home, but she knows it is #important# because it is her friend’s birthday. The #babysitter# should arrive at their house #soon#. </p><p>Mary feels Andrew’s cheek. He must have a fever, because it felt very warm. </p><p>“Come on, Andrew. The doctor said you have to take this #pill# once a day,” she says to her son. </p><p>Before Andrew could #argue#, Mary had put the medicine in his #mouth#. Mary put a cool #towel# on Andrew’s hot #forehead# and runs her fingers through his #silky# brown hair just as the #doorbell# rings. </p><p>“Hi, Sophie, how are you?” says Mary as she #opens# the door to the babysitter. </p><p>“I’m #fine#, thanks, Mary. It’s been #raining# so I got some #mud# on my shoes though. How’s Andrew?” asks Sophie. </p><p>“He’s not #feeling# well so I’m worried about him. He’s #sleeping# right now,” says Mary. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Mary. Andrew is #safe# with me,” says Sophie. Mary #waves# goodbye to Sophie as she leaves the house. She #throws# her #leather# purse onto the front #seat# of her #car# and drives away. </p><p> Mary loves #pizza# and when she arrives at the restaurant, she is #excited# to see a large sign on the #roof# that says “Daniella’s Pizzeria.” The restaurant is beautiful, and the #first# thing Mary sees is a big #painting# on the walls. Mary enjoys a wonderful #meal# with her friends. The pizza was #delicious#, but the best part was the #spiced# apple pie. Mary could still #taste# the #cinnamon# and #cloves# on her tongue as she #drove# home to her son.</p>
