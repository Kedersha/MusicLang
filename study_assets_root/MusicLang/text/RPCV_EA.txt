Mary is having a busy /week. She is worried about her son, Andrew, who is /sick, so it was hard for her to keep /track of her schedule. She almost forgot about the /special dinner tonight, even though she had /written it down in red /pen so she would remember. She doesn’t want to go to the dinner with Andrew at home, but she knows it is /important because it is her friend’s birthday. The /babysitter should arrive at their house /soon. Mary feels Andrew’s cheek. He must have a fever, because it felt very warm.

“Come on, Andrew. The doctor said you have to take this /pill once a day,” she says to her son.

Before Andrew could /argue, Mary had put the medicine in his /mouth. Mary put a cool /towel on Andrew’s hot /forehead and runs her fingers through his /silky brown hair just as the /doorbell rings.

“Hi, Sophie, how are you?” says Mary as she /opens the door to the babysitter.

“I’m /fine, thanks, Mary. It’s been /raining so I got some /mud on my shoes though. How’s Andrew?” asks Sophie.

“He’s not /feeling well so I’m worried about him. He’s /sleeping right now,” says Mary.

“Don’t worry, Mary. Andrew is /safe with me,” says Sophie. Mary /waves goodbye to Sophie as she leaves the house. She /throws her /leather purse onto the front /seat of her /car and drives away. Mary loves /pizza and when she arrives at the restaurant, she is /excited to see a large sign on the /roof that says “Daniella’s Pizzeria.” The restaurant is beautiful, and the /first thing Mary sees is a big /painting on the walls. Mary enjoys a wonderful /meal with her friends. The pizza was /delicious, but the best part was the /spiced apple pie. Mary could still /taste the /cinnamon and /cloves on her tongue as she /drove home to her son.
