Amy was excited to finally visit her friend. They have both been very busy from the 
/increase
 in their work hours, and there was a scheduling 
/conflict
 the last time they tried to meet. John had needed more time to 
/perfect
 his presentation for work, and Amy had a 
/deadline
 to meet for her 
/project
 as well. John was her oldest friend but it seems they live 
/separate
 lives now. Amy could 
/recall
 when she first met him. She was 8 years old, and her parents did not 
/permit
 her to have candy at the class Christmas party. John, the new student in class, 
/secretly
 offered to share his candy, and 
/together
 they vowed to 
/rebel
 against their parents and be friends forever.

Amy turned the corner and arrived at her friend’s apartment 
/complex
. As she neared the lobby doors, she heard a voice shout her name from above. She glanced up and there was John 
/waving
 at her, looking as 
/excited
 as she felt. Seconds later they were laughing and hugging in the building lobby, their time apart did not 
/affect
 the strength of their friendship.

They finally settled down on John's couch with cups of tea in hand.

“So tell me about your new job!” said Amy, unable to 
/contain
 her curiosity. To her, the fantastical world of 
/fashion
 was filled with glamour and intrigue. Aware of Amy’s 
/romanticized
 view, John rolled his eyes.

“I’m only the junior 
/manager
, so not much usually goes on. Although,” he paused dramatically for Amy’s 
/benefit
, “the 
/senior
 manager was sick last week and the team wanted me to 
/present
 the summer 
/proposal
 in her place!”

“That’s amazing! How did it go?” prompted Amy.

“Well it was great until this guy named Frank showed up.” John frowned. “ He walked in five 
/minutes
 late, and from then on seemed to 
/object
 to every proposal I made.

“For the 
/record
, he knew I worked with a team, but still talked as if I was the sole 
/creator
 of the whole 
/presentation
, and responsible for all the ideas. As if I could 
/produce
 that much 
/content
 myself! What an 
/insult
, the way he would 
/address
 me. Called me ‘Junior’. A co-worker on my team even came to my 
/defense
, ” said John.

“Frank doesn’t know what he’s talking about, you’re great at your job,” said Amy, in an effort to 
/console
 her friend. “You’ve been promoted twice in less than two years!”

“Frank’s been with the company for years though,” sighed John. “The board can’t just 
/discount
 what a senior 
/member
 has to say.”

“Maybe Frank’s just 
/jealous
 of you. Maybe he’s 
/intimidated
 by your great hair. Maybe,” Amy 
/wiggled
 her eyebrows, “Frank has a crush on you.”

The two friends laughed until they were 
/gasping
 for breath.
