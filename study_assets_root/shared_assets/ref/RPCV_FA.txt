'<p>Mary is having a busy #week#. She is worried about her #three# year old son, Andrew, who is #sick#, so it was hard for her to keep #track# of her schedule. ' + 
	'She almost forgot about the dinner tonight, even though she had written it down in red #pen# so she would remember. She doesn’t want to go to the dinner, while Andrew is at home alone, ' + 
	'but she knows it is important because it is her #friend’s# birthday. She put the gift #bag# for her friend by the door so she would remember to bring it when she #leaves#. ' + 
	'The babysitter should arrive at their house #soon#. </p><p>Mary feels Andrew’s #cheek#. He must have a #fever#, because it #felt# very warm. </p><p>“Come on, Andrew. #Sit# on this chair. ' + 
	'The doctor said you have to take this #pill# once a day,” she says to her son. Before Andrew could #refuse#, Mary had put the medicine in his #mouth#. ' + 
	'Mary went to get a cloth from the #messy# drawer under the #sink#. She #wet# the cloth in cold water before putting it on Andrew\'s hot forehead and ran her fingers through his brown hair just as the doorbell rings. ' + 	
	'</p><p>“Hi, Sophie, how are you?” says Mary as she opens the door to the babysitter. </p><p>“I’m good, thanks, Mary. It’s been #raining# so I got some water and #dirt# on my shoes though. How’s Andrew?” asks Sophie. ' + 
	'</p><p>“He’s not #feeling# well so I’m worried about him. He’s #sleeping# right now in his #bed#,” says Mary. </p><p>“Don’t worry, Mary. Andrew will be taken care of. He just needs some #rest#. ' + 
	'I will make him #soup# when he wakes up,” says Sophie. </p><p>Mary #throws# the car keys into her purse and then #waves# goodbye to Sophie as she leaves the house. She puts her #leather# purse into the trunk of her car. ' + 
	'She drives away to get #gas# before going to dinner. </p><p>Mary loves #pizza# and when she arrives at the restaurant, she is excited to see a large #green# sign on the window that #says# “Daniella’s Pizzeria.” ' +
	'She has heard that it is the #fourth# best Italian restaurant in the city, and that the pizza is also #cheap#. The restaurant is beautiful, and the #first# thing Mary #sees# is a big photo of the city of Rome on the walls. ' + 
	'Mary enjoys a wonderful #meal# eating good #food# and catching up with her friends. The pizza was delicious, but the #best# part was the spiced apple pie. ' +
